# Car Price Prediction

This project predicts car prices based on features such as company, model, year, fuel type, and kilometers driven. It utilizes regression techniques to estimate market value from structured data.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Car price prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook for preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- `car data.csv`: Dataset containing car details and prices.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 🚗 Dataset Features
